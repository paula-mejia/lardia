# Férias — Vacation Rules

## Basic Rights

- **30 days** of paid vacation per year (full-time workers)
- Plus **1/3 adicional** (constitutional bonus = salary/3)
- Guaranteed by LC 150/2015 and CLT

## Key Periods

### Período Aquisitivo
- 12 months of work to earn the right to vacation
- Each 12-month cycle = 1 vacation entitlement

### Período Concessivo
- Employer has 12 months AFTER the aquisitive period to grant vacation
- If exceeded (férias vencidas): employer must pay **double** the vacation amount

## Vacation Duration by Schedule

### Full-time (44h/week)
- 30 days

### Partial Schedule (up to 25h/week)
Proportional to weekly hours:
- 22-25h/week → 18 days
- 20-22h/week → 16 days
- 15-20h/week → 14 days
- 10-15h/week → 12 days
- 5-10h/week → 10 days
- Under 5h/week → 8 days

## Fracionamento (Splitting)

- Can be split into up to **3 periods**
- One period must be at least **14 consecutive days**
- Other periods: minimum 5 days each
- Employee must agree to the split

## Abono Pecuniário (Selling Vacation)

- Employee may sell up to **1/3 of vacation days** (10 days for full-time)
- Must request at least 15 days before end of aquisitive period
- Employer cannot force the sale

## Calculation

Base: monthly salary + habitual additions (if any)

**Example** (full 30 days, salary R$ 1.412,00):
- Salary for vacation period: R$ 1.412,00
- 1/3 adicional: R$ 470,67
- **Gross total: R$ 1.882,67**
- Minus: INSS deduction on total
- Payment deadline: **2 business days before vacation starts**

## Proportional Vacation (Férias Proporcionais)

- Calculated on termination: (months worked / 12) × 30 days
- Each month with 15+ days worked = 1/12 avo
- Also gets 1/3 adicional on the proportional amount

## Loss of Vacation Right

Employee loses vacation right if during the aquisitive period:
- Takes leave for 6+ months (even intermittent)
- Receives auxílio-doença or accident benefit from INSS for 6+ months

## eSocial Registration
- Vacation must be registered in eSocial before the start date
- System generates the vacation payroll automatically

### Vacation Date Decision
- The **employer** has the final say on when vacation is taken, not the employee
- However, the ideal practice is to reach a mutual agreement
- Common strategy: coordinate employee vacation with employer's own vacation/travel

### Vacation Calculation — Additional Details
- Must include the **average of overtime hours** worked during the aquisitive period in the vacation pay calculation
- Employee may request 13° salary advance (50% of salary) to be paid together with vacation
- This request must be made in January for vacation taken between February and November

### Abono Pecuniário — Detailed Rules
- The 30-day notice deadline is before the **end of the aquisitive period**, not before vacation starts
- Example: hired 01/01/2021, aquisitive period ends 31/12/2021 → must request by 01/12/2021
- The employer **cannot refuse** the abono pecuniário request — it is the employee's right
- Both the worked portion (up to 10 days) and the vacation portion (20 days) receive the 1/3 adicional
- Abono pecuniário increases total cost: employer pays salary for days worked + vacation pay for days off + 1/3 on the full 30-day base

### Férias Vencidas — Practical Impact
- If vacation period expires without granting vacation, employer pays **double** the entire vacation amount (salary + 1/3)
- This is one of the top causes of labor lawsuits against domestic employers
- Common mistake: employer "gives time off" during a trip but doesn't register in eSocial — this does NOT count as vacation

### Vacation and Dismissal
- A frequent employer error is dismissing the employee during travel and claiming those days as vacation
- Vacation fractions must be properly registered in eSocial and CTPS, and paid as required by law
