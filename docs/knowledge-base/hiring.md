## Step-by-Step Hiring Process

### 1. Define Needs
- Role, schedule, salary, start date
- Full-time (44h) vs partial (up to 25h)

### 2. Selection & Interview
- Check references from previous employers
- Verify documentation

### 3. Required Documents (from employee)
- CPF
- RG or identity document
- CTPS (Carteira de Trabalho) — now digital
- PIS/NIS number
- Proof of address
- Birth certificates of dependents (for salário-família)
- Vaccination card (dependents under 6)
- School enrollment proof (dependents 7-14)

### 4. Contract Types

#### Prazo Indeterminado (most common)
- Open-ended, no expiration date
- Standard for domestic employment

#### Contrato de Experiência
- Up to 45 days, renewable once (max 90 days total)
- Must be registered in eSocial as "prazo determinado"
- If not renewed → automatically becomes indefinite

#### Prazo Determinado
- Fixed end date
- Less common for domestic work

### 5. Contract Must Include
- Full names and CPFs of both parties
- Role/function (CBO)
- Start date
- Salary (gross)
- Work schedule (hours, days)
- Address of work
- Signatures of both parties
- Written, in duplicate

### 6. eSocial Registration
- Register employee in eSocial within 1 day of starting work
- Enter: personal data, CBO, salary, schedule, contract type
- This automatically generates the digital CTPS entry

### 7. CTPS (Carteira de Trabalho)
- Since 2019: digital CTPS via app or gov.br
- Registration in eSocial automatically updates the digital CTPS
- Physical CTPS still valid but digital is the standard

## What Employee CANNOT Do
- Work for profit-generating activities (e.g., employer's business)
- Work for multiple families under one contract
- Be required to live at employer's home without agreement

### Hiring Tips — Selection Process
1. **Check references**: Contact previous employers to understand work quality, trustworthiness, and whether the previous relationship was conflict-free
2. **Verify skills**: Ask about specific abilities — cooking, childcare, small repairs, types of cleaning
3. **Check criminal background**: Free service via [Polícia Federal website](https://www.gov.br/pf/pt-br/servicos/antecedentes-criminais)
4. **Assess fit**: Since the employee works inside your home, trust and personal compatibility matter more than in other employment

### Contract — Not Legally Required but Recommended
- A written contract is **NOT legally mandatory** — the eSocial registration + DAE payments fulfill legal requirements
- However, a written contract provides extra protection for both parties in disputes
- Essential clauses: work schedule, duties, salary, start date, notice rules
- **Illiterate employees**: cannot sign a contract — CTPS + eSocial registration serve as the employment proof

### Contract Modifications — What's Allowed
- Change of work shift (day ↔ night): allowed
- Change of function: allowed only for **promotion or lateral move** (never demotion)
- Change of work location: allowed (e.g., employer moved)
- Salary reduction: **never allowed** (constitutional prohibition)

### Damage Clause in Contract
- Employer may include a percentage-based damage deduction clause for broken/damaged items
- In practice, this serves more as a **warning** than a punitive measure
- Must be agreed in writing at contract signing

### Diarista vs. Doméstica — Key Distinction
- Diarista (≤2 days/week): **no employment relationship**, no CTPS, no eSocial, paid per day
- Doméstica (≥3 days/week): full employment relationship, must formalize
- **Critical**: Hiring a diarista for 3+ days/week at the same household creates an employment relationship even if called "diarista"
- Third option: **jornada parcial** (up to 25h/week) — registered like full-time but with proportional salary and vacation

### Contrato de Experiência — Detailed Rules
- Maximum total duration: **90 days** (not 3 months)
- Can be split into periods, but only **one renewal** allowed
- Example: 30 days + 60 days renewal = OK; 30 days + 30 days + 30 days = NOT allowed (two renewals)
- Employee must be fully registered in eSocial from day 1 (same as permanent hire)
- With digital CTPS, no separate annotation in physical carteira is needed
- Financial advantage: if terminated at end of experience period, no aviso prévio or 40% FGTS fine is due
- If not renewed or terminated: automatically becomes indefinite-term contract

### Regularization of Informal Employee
- Can register an employee who is already working informally with a **retroactive admission date**
- Must pay all back taxes (INSS, FGTS) with fines/interest from the actual start date
- All annotations (vacation, raises, etc.) must be retroactively recorded

### CBO — Additional Occupations
- Acompanhante de Idosos: 5162-10
- Arrumadeira: 5121-10
- Dama de companhia: 5162-10
- Marinheiro: 7827-21
- Governanta: 5131-05
- CBO change during employment: allowed only for promotion (with salary adjustment), registered in eSocial

### Documents Employer Must Provide and Retain
- **Deliver to employee**: signed salary receipt + paid DAE copy (monthly)
- **Employer retains**: DAE + bank proof (5 years from Jan of following year), salary/vacation/termination receipts (5 years from payment date)
- Pandemic-era agreements (suspension/reduction): retain for 5 years from agreement start date
