# eSocial Doméstico — Basics & Portal Usage

## What is eSocial Doméstico?

Government platform that unifies employer obligations: registration, payroll, tax collection (INSS, FGTS, IRRF) through a single system integrated with Carteira de Trabalho Digital.

## Registration (Cadastro)

- Employer must register via gov.br login
- Required: CPF of employer, employee data (CPF, NIS/PIS, birth date, address)
- Foreign employers can also register (specific flow available)
- **Always register the GROSS salary (salário bruto)**, not net — the system calculates deductions from gross

### Salary: Bruto vs. Líquido
- **Salário bruto** = registered in contract/CTPS, before deductions
- **Salário líquido** = what employee actually receives after deductions
- Deductions from gross: INSS (7.5%-14%), IRRF (if applicable), vale-transporte (6%)
- If you register net as gross, all tax contributions will be underpaid → fines

## DAE (Documento de Arrecadação do eSocial)

The unified monthly payment guide covering all employer obligations.

### What DAE Includes
- INSS (employee + employer contributions)
- FGTS (8% of gross salary)
- FGTS Compensatório (3.2% — provision for potential 40% termination fine)
- Seguro contra acidentes (0.8%)
- IRRF (if applicable based on salary)

### How to Generate DAE
1. Access eSocial Doméstico portal
2. Close the monthly payroll (folha de pagamento)
3. Generate the DAE guide
4. Pay by due date: **7th of following month** (or next business day)

### DAE in Arrears (em Atraso)
- Late DAE can be generated with automatic fine/interest calculation
- Penalties: fine of 0.33% per day (max 20%) + SELIC interest
- Access: eSocial > Folha/Recebimentos > select overdue month

## Payroll Management (Folha de Pagamento)

### Reopening Payroll
- If errors found after closing, payroll can be reopened in eSocial
- Navigate to the closed month and select "Reabrir"
- Make corrections, then close and regenerate DAE

## Titularity Transfer
- When the responsible employer changes (e.g., spouse becomes main employer)
- Done through eSocial portal with specific flow
- Does not break the employment contract — continuity maintained

## Key Portal Actions
- Employee registration/admission
- Monthly payroll closing
- DAE generation and payment
- Vacation registration
- Termination processing
- Salary adjustments (annual mandatory raise)
- CAT emission (workplace accident communication)
- Labor lawsuit registration (since Oct 2023)

### DAE Due Date Clarification
- The DAE due date is the **7th of the following month** (per INSS/FGTS rules), but NoLar notes that the **unified DAE guide** also has a **day 20 deadline** for some components
- When day 7 falls on a weekend/holiday, it is **brought forward** (antecipado), not postponed
- Late DAE must be generated and paid on the **same day** — it cannot be generated in advance with late fees pre-calculated for a future date

### eSocial Access Changes (gov.br)
- Since 2023, eSocial is accessed exclusively via **conta gov.br** (no more independent access codes)
- Employers must have a **silver or gold level** gov.br account
- Bronze-level users must upgrade via the gov.br mobile app (facial recognition)
- Integration with third-party services (like NoLar) requires a **digital power of attorney** (procuração) via Portal e-CAC

### Creating an eSocial Account (Legacy Method)
- Required: CPF, date of birth, last 2 IRPF declaration receipt numbers (10 digits, no check digit)
- If no IRPF declarations: título de eleitor (voter registration) instead
- Rectified IRPF declarations: use the rectified receipt number

### Restituição (Refund) from eSocial
- **FGTS overpayment**: Use "RDF – Retificação com Devolução do FGTS" form at Caixa Econômica Federal
- **Tax overpayment (INSS/IRRF)**: Use "Pedido de Restituição ou Ressarcimento" form from Receita Federal website
- Must select "Pagamento Indevido ou a Maior" option
- Use "Outras Informações" field for DAE-specific tax breakdowns
- Multiple overpayments can be consolidated into a single request

### Verifying DAE Payments
- eSocial does NOT issue payment receipts — use **Portal e-CAC** (Receita Federal) to verify
- Navigate to: Pagamentos e Parcelamentos > Consulta Comprovante de Pagamento > select "DAE" as document type
- Requires e-CAC access code (separate from eSocial)

### Comprovante de Rendimentos (Income Statement)
- Employers who withheld IRRF must issue the **Comprovante de Rendimentos** via eSocial
- Path: eSocial > Empregados > Informe de Rendimentos
- Must print, sign, and deliver a copy to the employee
- Employee uses it for their personal IRPF declaration

### DIRF (Declaração do Imposto de Renda Retido na Fonte)
- Required if employer withheld IRRF on any payment (salary, vacation, 13°, termination) where amount exceeded R$ 1,903.98
- Delivered via Programa Gerador da DIRF (Receita Federal)
- Penalty for late/incorrect filing: minimum R$ 200.00 fine + risk of malha fina
- Code for domestic workers: 0561 (Rendimento do Trabalho Assalariado)

### Titularity Transfer — Practical Steps
- eSocial still lacks a direct transfer function — new employer must create a new account and re-register the employee with the **same original admission date**
- No need to terminate the employee — having two registrations linked to the same employee is acceptable
- Annotate in CTPS "Anotações Gerais" page with new employer name and reason for transfer
- Common reasons: death of original employer, divorce/separation

### IRRF Timing in DAE
- IRRF follows **regime de caixa** (cash basis), not regime de competência
- If October salary is paid in November (by the 7th), the IRRF appears in the **November DAE**, paid in December
- This differs from INSS which follows competência (accrual basis)
