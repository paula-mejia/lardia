# 13° Salário — Thirteenth Salary

## What Is It?

Annual bonus equal to one registered monthly salary (if worked full year). Constitutional right guaranteed by LC 150/2015 and CLT.

## Eligibility

- Every domestic worker with signed CTPS
- Each month with **15+ days worked** = 1 avo (1/12 of bonus)
- 12/12 avos = full salary as 13°

## Payment Schedule

### Two Installments
1. **1ª parcela**: by **November 30**
   - Value: 50% of gross salary
   - No deductions (INSS/IRRF)
2. **2ª parcela**: by **December 20**
   - Value: remaining 50%
   - INSS and IRRF deducted on FULL 13° amount (not just 2nd installment)

### Single Payment Option
- Can pay in one installment by November 30
- All deductions applied at once

## Calculation

**Full year (12/12 avos):**
- 13° = monthly registered salary

**Proportional (e.g., hired mid-year):**
- 13° = (salary / 12) × number of avos earned
- Example: hired in July, worked 6 months = 6/12 avos = half salary

## 13° During Vacation
- Employee can request 1st installment together with vacation payment
- Must request by January 31 of that year

## Taxes on 13°
- INSS: deducted on 2nd installment (calculated on full 13°)
- FGTS: 8% calculated on each installment
- IRRF: if applicable, on 2nd installment

## 13° on Termination
- Proportional 13° is paid in all types of termination except justa causa
- Calculated based on months worked in the current year

## eSocial
- System automatically calculates 13° based on registered salary
- Employer must close the 13° payroll in November and December
- DAE for 13° generated separately

### Eligibility Starts at 15 Days
- The right to 13° begins after just **15 days** of employment (not 1 month)
- Each month with 15+ days worked = 1 avo

### 1ª Parcela — Important Restriction
- Cannot be paid in **January** — only from February 1 to November 30
- Can be paid together with vacation if employee requests it in January

### Deductions for Absences
- Months where the employee had **more than 15 unjustified absences** can be deducted (lose 1 avo)
- However, only **unjustified** absences count — medical certificates (atestados) do not count against

### Deductions During INSS Leave
- Months where the employee was on licença-maternidade or auxílio-doença: INSS pays those avos, not the employer
- Employer only calculates avos for months actually worked

### Acréscimos (Additions) to 13°
- If employee regularly works with **adicional noturno**, the average of night shift premiums during the year must be added to the 13° calculation
- Same applies for habitual **overtime** (horas extras): average over the year is included

### 13° and Suspension/Reduction (COVID-era Legacy)
- During periods of contract suspension, employee does NOT accrue avos for 13°
- During salary reduction: 13° is calculated based on the **original (unreduced) salary**, not the reduced one
- These rules from the emergency pandemic legislation (2020-2021) may still affect calculations for older contracts
