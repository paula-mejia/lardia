### FGTS — Historical Context
- FGTS became mandatory for domestic workers on **October 1, 2015** (competência 10/2015)
- Before that date it was **optional**, but once elected by employer, it became irrevocable until contract termination
- For retroactive deposits (pre-10/2015): employer generates separate FGTS guides via Caixa Econômica website

### FGTS Compensatório (3.2%) — Detailed Mechanics
- This is a **substitute** for the 40% termination fine that applies to other workers
- The 3.2% is deposited monthly into a separate account (not the regular 8% FGTS account)
- It accumulates over the contract duration and is only released upon termination
- **Destination by termination type:**
  - Sem justa causa: 100% to employee
  - Acordo mútuo: 50% to employee, 50% returnable to employer
  - Culpa recíproca: 50% to employee
  - Justa causa / Pedido de demissão: 100% returnable to employer
  - Employee death: 100% returnable to employer
- Employer withdraws at Caixa Econômica with: RG, CPF, proof of address, TRCT
