### Overtime Calculation — Step by Step
1. Find hourly rate: salary ÷ (weekly hours × 5 weeks) — always use 5 weeks/month
2. Example: R$ 1.621,00 ÷ 220h = R$ 7.37/hour
3. Regular overtime: hourly rate × 1.5 (50% bonus) = R$ 11.05
4. Sunday/holiday overtime: hourly rate × 2.0 (100% bonus) = R$ 14.73
5. Employee is NOT obligated to work overtime — it must be agreed

### Banco de Horas (Compensation Agreement) — Detailed Rules
- Must be formalized in a **written agreement** signed by both parties
- First 40 overtime hours: must be compensated within the **same month**
- Remaining hours: employer has up to **1 year** to grant compensatory time off
- Example: 60 overtime hours in April → compensate 40h by May, remaining 20h by April of next year
- Key: maintain time tracking records (digital or physical) — mandatory per Art. 12 of LC 150/2015

### Lunch Break — Important Details
- For jornadas above 6h: minimum 1h, maximum 2h break
- Can be reduced to **30 minutes** via written agreement
- If reduced: employee must leave **earlier** at end of day; if they work during the saved time, employer owes overtime
- Break is NOT counted as work time
- For jornadas of 4-6h: 15 minutes
- For jornadas under 4h: no break required

### Jornada Parcial — Salary Calculation
- Formula: (minimum wage ÷ 44h) × weekly hours
- Example at R$ 1.621,00: 24h/week → (1,621 ÷ 44) × 24 = R$ 884.18
- Proportional salary must respect minimum wage base (national or regional)

### Employee Who Sleeps at Workplace
- Working hours remain the same (44h/week max) — living on-site does not extend the workday
- Night work still requires adicional noturno (20%) + overtime if applicable
- If employee is "on call" (prontidão) during sleeping hours: entitled to ⅔ of hourly rate for standby time
- Employer must provide meals and work supplies at no cost to employee
- Vale-transporte: only paid for days the employee actually commutes home (not days sleeping at work)
- Weekly rest (DSR): must still be granted — 1 day off per 6 worked, including at least 1 Sunday/month

### Absence Deduction Rules
- Formula: salary bruto ÷ 30 × days with unjustified absences
- Progressive discipline recommended before deducting:
  1. First offense: verbal warning
  2. Second offense: written warning (signed by employee)
  3. Third offense onwards: salary deduction
- **30+ consecutive unjustified absences** = abandono de emprego → may justify demissão por justa causa
- Consult a labor attorney before applying justa causa

### Acúmulo e Desvio de Função (Function Accumulation/Deviation)
- **Acúmulo**: employee performs tasks beyond their registered CBO without extra pay (e.g., housekeeper also cooking)
- **Desvio**: employee stops performing their registered function and does a different one entirely
- If proven in court: employer owes ~20% of the other function's salary for the entire period
- Prevention: define all duties clearly in the contract, keep documentation updated, avoid assigning tasks outside the registered CBO

### Holiday Anticipation
- Employers may anticipate holidays (grant the day off on a different date) via written agreement
- Common during events like World Cup, Olympics, or municipal holidays
- Must be documented and agreed upon
