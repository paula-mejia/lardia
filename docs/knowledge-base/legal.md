# Aspectos Legais — Legal Issues

## Ações Trabalhistas (Labor Lawsuits)

### Common Causes
- Unpaid overtime
- Missing FGTS deposits
- No CTPS registration (informal employment)
- Incorrect termination payments
- Missing vacation payments
- Moral harassment / degrading conditions

### eSocial Integration (since Oct 2023)
- All finalized labor lawsuits must be registered in eSocial
- Applies to: homologated agreements and final condemnations
- Employer must report tax bases for FGTS, INSS, IRRF recalculation
- Deadline: upon becoming aware of final decision
- Can be entered via web service or specific eSocial module

### Prevention
- Keep all records: receipts, time sheets, contracts
- Use digital time tracking (proof of hours worked)
- Pay all obligations via DAE on time
- Maintain written contract with clear terms

## Informalidade (Informality)

### Scale of the Problem
- Only ~1.4 million of 6+ million domestic workers are formally registered (2023 PNAD data)
- ~75% work informally without CTPS

### Risks for Employer
- Labor lawsuit with **retroactive rights** (up to 5 years)
- FGTS + INSS back payments with fines and interest
- Multa rescisória
- Criminal liability in some cases (labor fraud)
- No legal protection in disputes

### Risks for Employee
- No access to INSS benefits (retirement, auxílio-doença, etc.)
- No FGTS accumulation
- No seguro-desemprego if dismissed
- No legal protection or recourse
- Social vulnerability

### How to Formalize
1. Register employer on eSocial (gov.br login)
2. Register employee with personal data + CBO + salary
3. System generates digital CTPS entry automatically
4. Generate and pay DAE monthly

## Multas e Penalidades (Fines)

### Late DAE Payment
- Fine: 0.33% per day (max 20%) + SELIC interest
- Applies to INSS and FGTS portions

### Not Registering Employee
- Subject to labor lawsuit for all unpaid rights
- INSS/FGTS retroactive with corrections
- Potential fine from Ministério do Trabalho

### Missing Vacation Payment
- Must pay double if vacation period expires (férias vencidas)

### Late Termination Payment
- Fine of 1 monthly salary if termination payments exceed 10-day deadline

### Top 7 Causes of Labor Lawsuits (Ações Trabalhistas)
1. **Failure to grant vacation** — especially "informal" time off not registered in eSocial
2. **No CTPS registration / no eSocial record** — most basic violation
3. **Unpaid or miscalculated overtime** — lack of time tracking is the main issue
4. **Acúmulo or desvio de função** — employee performs tasks beyond registered CBO without additional pay
5. **Missing FGTS deposits** — employer skips DAE payments
6. **Incorrect termination calculations** — underpaying verbas rescisórias
7. **Moral harassment / degrading conditions** — includes overwork, verbal abuse, isolation

### Acúmulo de Função — Legal Consequences
- When proven in court: indenização of approximately **20% of the other function's salary** for the entire accumulated period
- Example: empregada doméstica (CBO 5121-05) also acting as cozinheira (CBO 5132-10) without pay adjustment
- Burden of proof is on the employee (documents, witnesses)
- Prevention: maintain detailed contract, avoid assigning tasks outside the registered CBO, adjust salary if duties expand

### Document Retention Schedule (for Legal Protection)
| Document | Retention Period | Starting From |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| DAE + bank proof | 5 years | January of following year |
| Salary receipts (signed) | 5 years | Payment date |
| Vacation receipts (signed) | 5 years | Payment date |
| TRCT / TQRCT | 5 years | Payment date |
| Pandemic agreements | 5 years | Agreement start date |
| Time tracking records | 5 years | End of aquisitive period |

### Reforma Trabalhista Impact on Domestic Workers (Lei 13.467/2017)
- Introduced **rescisão por acordo** (mutual termination) — applied to domestic workers via CLT subsidiária
- Did NOT change fundamental domestic worker rights (still governed by LC 150/2015)
- Key reforms applicable: banco de horas individual, fractioning of vacation into 3 periods, contract intermitente (debated applicability)

### Estabilidade Provisória — When Employer Cannot Dismiss
- **Pregnant employee**: from confirmation through 5 months postpartum (all contract types, including experiência)
- **After work accident (auxílio-doença acidentário)**: 12 months after return
- Dismissal during stability period → reinstatement or payment of all wages through end of stability
- Even if employer didn't know about pregnancy at dismissal time → retroactive stability applies

### Convenções Coletivas
- Some regions have collective bargaining agreements (convenções coletivas) for domestic workers
- May establish additional rights: stability in other situations, different salary floors, specific benefits
- Always check the sindicato representing domestic workers in the area where services are performed
